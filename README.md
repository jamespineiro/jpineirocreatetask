James Pineiro's APCSP Create Task Game

The purpose of this code is to run an idle game for people to play in their free time while finishing various other tasks in their lives. This was made solely
in Python with the help of the Pygame library, and this was my APCSP Create Task Project. To run my code, simply download the necessary files attached,
and then you should be all set to run it as needed. The outputs from this code will simply be the complete game, accessible at any time. The game begins
from a fresh start on every launch (Does not save between runs/plays).
